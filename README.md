# JDM Frontend Admin Buttons
JDM Frontend Admin Buttons is a lightweight WordPress plugin that hides the default Admin Bar and replaces it with out of the way, contextually-aware, floating buttons for basic admin tasks.

## Description
The WordPress admin bar gets in the way of basic frontend management of your WordPress site&mdash;esspecially if you have a fixed main navigation.  This simple and VERY light-weight plugin offers floating buttons that are contextually-aware and fixed to one side so they're out of the way.

A few goals we had in making this plugin:

*	Keep it free and feature-rich
*	Keep it simple (stupid)
*	Must be SUPER lightweight (we hate plugin bloat)
*	Build for developers and noobs alike

The plugin is still in BETA, but you're welcome to take a look at how it's coming over on <a href="http://labs.jdmdigital.co/plugins/frontend-admin-buttons/" target="_blank">JDM Labs</a>.

## Installation

3. That's it!
