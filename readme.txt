JDM Frontend Admin Buttons is a lightweight WordPress plugin that hides the default Admin Bar and replaces it with out of the way, contextually-aware, floating buttons for basic admin tasks.

== Description ==
The WordPress admin bar gets in the way of basic frontend management of your WordPress site&mdash;esspecially if you have a fixed main navigation.  This simple and VERY light-weight plugin offers floating buttons that are contextually-aware and fixed to one side so they're out of the way.
